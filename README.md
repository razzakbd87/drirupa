Drirupa (দৃরূপা) Bangla(Bengali) Language pre-processor to process scan image and prepare for OCR conversion.
In the Bangla(Bengali) language written and printed system, alphabets are consecutively connected with a line called "matra" in most of the word.
So, Operation of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on Bangla(Bangali) language is different from other languages.

To make the Bangla (Bengali) OCR preprocessor we divide our system into four(4) parts: 

1. Image Detection (Conversion of scan image to black and white)
2. Line Detection
3. Word Detection
4. Alphabet Detection
